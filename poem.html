<p>Whose Direction is that? I think I know.
<p>Its owner is quite sad though.
<p>It really is a tale of woe,
<p>I watch him frown. I cry hello.</p>
            <br>
<p>He gives his Direction a shake,
<p>And sobs until the tears make.
<p>The only other sound's the break,
<p>Of distant waves and birds awake.</p>
            <br>
<p>The Direction is success, failure and deep,
<p>But he has promises to keep,
<p>Until then he shall not sleep.
<p>He lies in bed with ducts that weep.</p>
            <br>
<p>He rises from his bitter bed,
<p>With thoughts of sadness in his head,
<p>He idolises being dead.
<p>Facing the day with never ending dread.</p>
