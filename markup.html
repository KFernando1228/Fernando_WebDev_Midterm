<p><strong>Whose Direction is that? I think I know.</strong>
<p><em>Its owner is quite sad though.</em>
<p><em>It really is a tale of woe,</em>
<p><em>I watch him frown. I cry hello.</em>
</p>
            
            <br>
            
<p><strong>He gives his Direction a shake,</strong>
<p><em>And sobs until the tears make.</em>
<p><em>The only other sound's the break,</em>
<p><em>Of distant waves and birds awake.</em>
</p>
           
           <br>
            
<p><strong>The Direction is success, failure and deep,</strong>
<p><em>But he has promises to keep,</em>
<p><em>Until then he shall not sleep.</em>
<p><em>He lies in bed with ducts that weep.</em>
